            These are your own words
            your way of noticing
            and saying plainly
            of not turning away
            from hurt

            you have offered them
            to me I am only
            giving them back

            if only I could show you
            how very useless
            they are not

          <h2>Margaret Atwood</h2>
          <p>
            at the back where we squat
            outside, eating popcorn

            the edge of the receding glacier

            where painfully and with wonder
            at having survived even
            this far

            we are learning to make fire

          <h1>The More Loving One</h1>
          <h2>W.H. Auden</h2>
          <p>
            Were all stars to disappear or die,
            I should learn to look at an empty sky
            And feel its total dark sublime,
            Though this might take me a little time.

          <h1>Always For The First Time</h1>
          <h2>Andre Breton</h2>
          <p>
            There is a silk ladder unrolled across the ivy
            There is
            That leaning over the precipice
            Of the hopeless fusion of your presence and absence
            I have found the secret
            Of loving you
            Always for the first time.

          <h1>Married Love</h1>
          <h2>Guan Daosheng</h2>
          <p>
            You and I
            Have so much love,
            That it
            Burns like a fire,
            In which we bake a lump of clay
            Molded into a figure of you
            And a figure of me.
